# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## **Component 3** 

Web UI


### **Initializing component 3:**  

Web UI is designed using React js with typescript. React Js allows development of complex user interfaces. Typescript adds semantic correction to core javascript hence, allows writing robust javascript code. 

1. Clone the github repo SG_StockExecutionSystem to a local folder.
2. Inside the repository there is a folder named SG-StockExecutionSystem-WebUI. This contains the Web UI code. 
3. Open SG-StockExecutionSystem-WebUI folder using visual studio IDE.
4. open terminal in the project folder or navigate in the project folder through the terminal.
5. Run **npm install** to install all the dependencies of the project. 
6. Run **npm start** to run the Web UI application. 
7. The Web UI application will run on port 3000
8. Type following url to access Web UI: http://localhost:3000/


Third party Packages used for web UI: 
1. React admin

This is used to bootstrap the react project. React admin provides components and styles that are used to bootstrap a react application. 
React admin makes use of Material UI to provide styles for the react components. React router and fetch() method are used for sending HTTP requests from Web UI to Web API. react router and fetch() method are built into the react admin package. 

2. react redux 
3. redux toolkit

These are used for the flux architecture of the application. Redux toolkit allows efficient state management through store/action/disptach/reducer logic of the flux architecture.
